# wordlebyjoe
This is copy of the original Wordle program written in C++ using SFML libraries for the graphics. It is a stand-alone application that runs on Windows (soon Linux, and then, maybe Macs). The source code will be added soon and a more detailed description. For now, it is available for test only. Please let me know on any problems or issues.

Download the zip file, unzip it, and execute the file, "wordlebyjoe.exe". You will have to override the "Don't run" protection on the application. Thanks for your participation.
